<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The P channel MOSFET Transistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enhancement Type</li><li>Depletion Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>P channel MOSFET transistors are categorized into two main types - Enhancement Type and Depletion Type. </p><p>Enhancement Type transistors require a positive voltage on the gate to create a conductive channel between the source and drain terminals, enhancing the transistor's conductivity. </p><p>Depletion Type transistors, on the other hand, already have a conductive channel present when no voltage is applied to the gate. A negative voltage on the gate is used to deplete or reduce the conductivity of the channel between the source and drain terminals.</p></p>
