<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NOx Adsorbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active NOx Adsorbers</li><li>Passive NOx Adsorbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active NOx adsorbers are systems that actively inject a reductant such as ammonia or hydrocarbons into the exhaust stream to reduce NOx emissions. Passive NOx adsorbers, on the other hand, rely on natural exhaust temperature fluctuations to promote the release of stored NOx and regenerate the catalyst. Both types of adsorbers are used in exhaust systems to meet stringent emissions regulations and reduce harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere.</p></p>
