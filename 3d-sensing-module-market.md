<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Sensing Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TOF Technology 3D Sensing</li><li>Structured Light 3D Sensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>3D Sensing Module market is segmented into two types based on the technology used: TOF (Time-of-Flight) Technology 3D Sensing and Structured Light 3D Sensing. TOF technology utilizes a sensor to measure the time it takes for light to bounce back from an object, providing accurate depth perception. On the other hand, Structured Light 3D Sensing projects a pattern of light onto an object and analyzes the distortion of the pattern to determine depth. Both technologies are crucial for applications like facial recognition, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles.</p></p>
