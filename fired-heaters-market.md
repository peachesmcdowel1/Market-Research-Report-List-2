<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fired Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fired Heaters</li><li>Indirect Fired Heaters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fired heaters are widely used in various industries for heating purposes. There are two main types of fired heaters in the market. Direct fired heaters have the combustion gases come in direct contact with the material being heated, making them efficient for high-temperature applications. Indirect fired heaters, on the other hand, have the combustion gases enclosed in a separate chamber, making them suitable for heating sensitive materials or in situations where contamination needs to be avoided. Both types offer different advantages depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
