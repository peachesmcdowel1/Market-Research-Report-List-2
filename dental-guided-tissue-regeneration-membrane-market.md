<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Guided Tissue Regeneration Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental guided tissue regeneration membranes are used in periodontal procedures to promote tissue regeneration. Absorbable membranes are made of materials that break down over time, allowing for natural tissue regrowth. Non-absorbable membranes are designed to remain in place permanently, providing a long-term barrier for regeneration. Both types of membranes have their benefits and are used based on the specific needs of the patient and the procedure being performed.</p></p>
