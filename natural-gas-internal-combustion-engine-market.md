<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Internal Combustion Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spark Ignition</li><li>Compression Ignition</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Natural Gas Internal Combustion Engine Market consists of two main types: Spark Ignition and Compression Ignition. </p><p>Spark Ignition engines ignite a mixture of natural gas and air using a spark plug, similar to gasoline engines. These engines are commonly used in smaller vehicles and power equipment. Compression Ignition engines compress the natural gas until it reaches a high enough temperature to ignite without a spark plug. These engines are typically found in larger vehicles like trucks and buses, as well as in power generators and industrial equipment.</p></p>
