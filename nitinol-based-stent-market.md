<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitinol based Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Nitinol based Stent Market includes two main types: Bare-metal Stent (BMS) and Drug-eluting Stent (DES). Bare-metal Stents are metallic mesh tubes used to keep arteries open after angioplasty, providing structural support but lacking any drug coating. In contrast, Drug-eluting Stents have a special coating that slowly releases medication to prevent the growth of scar tissue inside the artery. DES are effective in reducing the risk of restenosis compared to BMS, but may also carry a higher risk of blood clots.</p></p>
